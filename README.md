# SDSS Datathon 2025 Real Estate Data Analysis
What is the ultimate factor that drives the real estate market? Obviously, there are many, so many that the scope of one dataset is not sufficient to describe all the variables that impact housing price. To broaden the coverage of our analysis we incorporate another dataset through data cleaning and feature engineering to explore new relationships that may have been hidden from the original dataset that may very well increase our precision of prediction. How safe we are in our homes and neighbourhoods is vital for long term living and investments of real estate. This analysis of real estate and Toronto crime data utilizes geospatial data and various other variables to predict real estate prices in Toronto accurately using a Tensorflow Kera model, yielding >88% accuracy and accounting for >91% variance.

The submission includes a comprehensive report of exploratory data analysis results, methodology, introductions to the problem and proposal, plenty of visualizations, R code for model validation and variable selection based on statistsical significance, and the code for data cleaning, feature engineering, preprocessing and model training in a python notebook.

ArcGIS Pro is used to craft comprehensive geospatial visualizations of datasets to aid with comprehension.

Use of generative AI: LLM models that were used to aid us on data cleaning, debugging, and organization of our code includes: DeepSeek R1 and OpenAI o3 mini.
